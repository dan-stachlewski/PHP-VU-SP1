1. just learned how to use git last night
2. next project will be tracked with Version Control via Git
3. email zipped folder as well named:dw-505-a1-s4532350
4. 2 folders:
4.1 Final assessment: a1-complex-form-s4532350
4.2 How I wanted page to look: old-version

Do yo have better or preferred folder naming conventions?

Copy of old version is just to show you the layout I wanted for the site but couldn't get errors to display so re-constructed the finished form old school.

I have made lots of notes about what I wanted to work on in future to complete the form and also what I liked about doing this task. I hope to be able to sit down and address some of these tasks some day.

I have uploaded a copy to GitHub as backup - URL:
